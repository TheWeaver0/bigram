**GitHub Project Description: Bigram Language Model with PyTorch**  

This project implements a **Bigram Language Model** from scratch using PyTorch, demonstrating how even simple neural architectures can learn patterns in text through the fundamentals of forward propagation and backpropagation. The model trains on a text corpus, learns character-level dependencies, and generates new text sequences.  

### Key Components  
- **Data Pipeline**: Loads and tokenizes text, splits into training/validation sets, and creates input-target batches for training.  
- **Model Architecture**: Uses an embedding layer to map characters to logits, with cross-entropy loss for optimization.  
- **Training Loop**: Implements gradient descent with the AdamW optimizer, evaluates loss on both training and validation sets.  
- **Text Generation**: Generates new text by sampling from the model's predicted probability distribution.  

### Example Generated Output  
After training:

### What I Learned  
- **Simplicity of Learning**: Complex neural networks are not always necessary. A single embedding layer (essentially a matrix of weights) paired with backpropagation can capture meaningful patterns in data.  
- **Forward Propagation** is about evaluating a mathematical function (here, transforming input tokens into logits).  
- **Backpropagation** adjusts the model’s weights to minimize prediction error, proving that learning boils down to iterative optimization of a loss function.  
- **Text Generation**: Sampling strategies (e.g., softmax and multinomial sampling) are critical for balancing creativity and coherence in outputs.  

### Tools Used  
- PyTorch for tensor operations, autograd, and model architecture.  
- Google Colab for GPU acceleration and seamless integration with Google Drive.  

This project reinforces that **learning is not about complexity** but understanding how to design and optimize functions through forward/backward passes. Even a "simple" bigram model can generate surprisingly structured text!
